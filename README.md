# Overview

The Maker's Corner is a website for artists, creators, and most importantly makers of all mediums. A maker is just that, someone who wants to grab a tool of any kind and make something. Makers often experiment with new things and are constantly learning to incorporate new skills and techniques to make something unique.  Sometimes in this process it is easy to get stuck and a youTube video from 6 years ago just is not helping anymore and you wish you could just ask someone who knows what they are talking about.  That's where The Maker's corner comes in. The Maker's Corner is a social media learning platform where a user can post questions to other makers, buy and download project plans or blueprints and take virtual classes.

# Features

  ## Message Board
  
  The message board allows a user to post questions to other makers and they can respond with tips and adivice.  Others can also         comment on those post to continue the conversation.
  
  ## Blueprints
  
  Here users can sell and purchase plans or blueprints and download them directly to their computers or phones. This allows users to     make something someone else designed and give credit where credit is due. This site is not about buying things, it's about making. That's why no products other than classes and blueprints are for sale on this site because we want you to make it and feel that pride that comes from making something with your own two hands.
  
  ## Courses
  
  This is a feature for the times.  In an era of virtual learning, amazon and loot crates, this feature rises up. A user can browse       offered courses from professionals and fellow makers.  These scheduled classes can be anything from, how to do Stained glass, to making a train whistle. The unique aspect of the courses is that we will send you a package of materials and tools that are included in the course price and all you have to do is join the scheduled online class and learn from a teacher live.  If you get stuck or have additional questions, just ask!  
  
# Big Picture

We want to encourage people to make things through community, inpiration, and education. More and more people are lacking the skills and resourcefulness to make and create or even know where to start to create. We need to turn off the video games, stop watching mindless videos and learn a new skill and be inspired by others who take pride in making things with their own hands. The world needs makers. A maker made the first artifical heart, or the first wheelchair. The possibilities are endless and who knows you might just someday change the world.
